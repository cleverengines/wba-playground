“Hello, and welcome to the Whole Brand Academy.


My name is Nick Souter and I’ll be one of your tutors as we take you through a unique process that will teach you how you can use the power of a brand to build your business and to build your career. We’ll show you how to launch a brand from scratch or deconstruct an existing brand, redefine it and then relaunch it.  More importantly, we’ll show you how to harness the power of a brand to do a great deal more than simply promote a product or a service.


These days, the term ‘Brand’ is used quite ambiguously – some people might say it is a logo, or a story, or a set of values or proposition. And, of course, it’s all of these things. So, one core purpose of our training is to create a simple and unifying understanding of what a brand is and what it can do so that use that knowledge to help build your career and help build the businesses on which you work. (Which, for some of you, may be a business that you own.)

So, a little bit about me:


I’ve been an advertising Creative Director for over 25 years and worked in the UK, the US, Japan and finally ended up in Australia as the Chairman and National Creative Director of Leo Burnett’s agencies here.


And, in that time, I’ve been fortunate enough to work on a wide range of well-known brands in virtually every category and in every medium.


(SHOW THE ANIMATION OF LOGOS THAT JESS CREATED)


But it was while I was focusing on creativity that I started to appreciate the far reaching power of a well-developed brand and understand what it can do that goes way beyond what I was trying to do within in the area of communication.


I think like many people in my line of work, I’d always viewed brands or ‘branding’ as a primarily a marketing exercise. And believed that brands belong in the marketing department.


But I’ve come to think differently, very differently.


While brands do play a critical role in the lives of those who work in marketing, I believe they’re just as valuable in the boardroom


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Why?


Because a brand is more than a marketing tool. It’s a business tool – one that drives revenue while reducing cost. And those are business imperatives. Those are the conversations that are happening in the boardroom.


How does this work?


Well, brands are highly effective and valuable both inside and outside of an organisation.


A strong and powerful brand not only attracts your target consumer and creates a competitive edge for a product or service in a crowded marketplace, (and all categories are pretty crowded these days), it attracts, motivates and retains the best employees and spares you the costly services of a recruitment agent or suffer the financial drain of a high churn rate.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


And so, we’ve developed a methodology that embraces and enhances everything a brand can do both inside and outside of an organisation. We call this Brand Symmetry as it balances inside and out. And we engineer the brand using the process of  ‘Whole Brain Thinking’ which acts as a unifying theory that gives us a holistic understanding of how all the different parts of the brand fit together and supports all of the different skills we teach. We call that Whole Brain Branding.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So, what can we do for you?


These courses are of real value to anyone who wants to succeed within the corporate or small business worlds. Anyone. If you currently work, or want to work in any of these categories, I’ve made a list here, then we can help - marketing, sales, human resources, product development, advertising, people and resource management, market research, digital development, PR, Retail Design, really the list is nearly endless, and there are many industries that are adjacent to these where an understanding of brands will give you a competitive edge.


So, I invite you to look through the curriculum and find your entry point into the programme.


We’ve divided and organised the modules into three broad categories. They are:


MARKETING, MANAGEMENT AND HR


ENTREPRENEURS AND COMPANY OWNERS


STUDENTS AND CAREER SWITCHERS


These categories aren’t mutually exclusive as these skills are easily transferred from one role to the next and, once in the program,  you’ll be free to move between them.


All of the programs include advice on how to us the ever-increasing number of ai tools that are available to help you. I stress help, not replace you! We want you to have a framework of criteria that enables you to judge what is good and effective. And that requires intuition, which in the world of ai is your superpower!!


The first module is free and is called quite simply, ‘What is a brand?’


For you, I hope this proves to be the start of a journey that you will really enjoy – one that’s insightful, informative, engaging and fun, (after all there’s a huge component of creativity, empathy and emotion in good branding), but most of all we want you to find these courses empowering. We want to give you an understanding and set of skills that will serve you well throughout your career and really help you achieve your goals.


So, check out the free module. I hope you find it helpful.


And I look forward to seeing you in the program.”
