BRAND ON A PAGE


So, this brings us to the last piece of the puzzle. Once we add the Brand Promise to this Whole Brain Deconstruction of the brand, we have a complete Brand on a Page.


In the case of biG, our Brand Promise needed to connect our unique methodology, the Whole Brain Branding Model, with the client need for growth and business success.


(Insert biG BOAP without Brand Promise)


So, we started here:


(Insert biG BOAP with ‘Bigger Thinking, Bigger Business’.


Bigger Thinking for Bigger Business.


Apart from the connection to the company name, we felt this promise started to capture the expanded thinking of the Whole Brain Model and connect it to the promise of growth.


Then, from this thought, we developed a slightly sharper expression of the sentiment:


(Insert biG BOAP with ‘High level thinking, bottom line results’)


High level thinking, bottom line results.


Again, this connected biG’s methodology of Whole Brain Thinking with increased business performance.


As you can see, this promise also plays a role in the ‘Why’ at the bottom of the page. biG’s driving belief is that a brand is more than a marketing tool, it’s a business tool and belongs in the boardroom as much, if not more than, in the marketing department.


But I think it’s worth stressing again, that a Brand Promise is not an endline. It’s that enduring thought that acts as the DNA of the brand. It needs to implicit, not explicit in everything we do.


For example, you’ll never see the words ‘Consumer Champion’ attached to the Virgin logo in any of the categories in which they operate. But all of their communication is implying this promise while their products and services are striving to deliver it.


And so, in the case of biG, while the Brand Promise is ‘High level thinking for bottom line results’, you’ll never see those words in their promotional materials.


What you’ll see are these words, ‘Competitive Advantage’.


These words don’t capture the Brand Promise. They capture the ‘consumer end benefit’ and so they do appear in consumer communication.


There’s a chain of thinking here and it’s simply this:


‘High level thinking for bottom line results’ delivers a ‘competitive advantage’.


The important distinction to make is that while the Brand Promise is enduring, the expression of the ‘consumer end benefit’ can change from one campaign to another. As long as it remains consistent with the Brand Promise.


We’ll investigate ‘Consumer End Benefits’ in greater depth when we look at how to write a communication or advertising creative brief.


But for the moment, let’s review everything we have on the Brand-on-a-Page.


(Insert biG BOAP and highlight numbered sections as we go through them.)


Taking it from the top:


1. Category Driver. Let’s state, as clearly as we can, the world our brand is operating in. A world that contains all of its relevant competitors. Here, we’re saying that biG is competing against Brand Consultancies and, in general terms, these companies help clients develop a better name and reputation as part of their marketing program.


2. Product and Process. This is where start to use the Whole Brain Model to compartmentalise the attributes of the brand. As you’ll recall from the module on Whole Brain Thinking, Queen quadrant people tend to ask the question ‘How?’. In this context, ‘How does the brand operate, and how does it bring value to the market?’


3. Source of Authority. In the Blue Quadrant we’re talking to those who focus on facts, on evidence, on proof. They are asking ‘What?’ What are my reasons to believe in this brand.


4. Rational Engagement. Here we are extrapolating from the Blue and Green to understand how we want people to think about the Brand.


5. Service Drivers. What attitudes, values and beliefs will drive us to create the rational engagement we desire with the customer or client.


So, that completes the left-brain picture of the brand, now let’s move to the right hemisphere.


6. Points of Difference and Future. Most categories are crowded with ‘me too’, parity products. So, yellow quadrant thinkers like to ask ‘Why?’ and, in this instance, they are asking ‘Why is this brand different? What attributes of the brand create a meaningful advantage? And why will this brand evolve and stay relevant in a world of such rapid change?


7. Style and Personality. The Red Quadrant thinkers will be the ones most likely to humanise and personalise the brand and ask, ‘Who is this brand?’ How will I relate to it? How will it talk to me?


8. Emotional Engagement. Here we extrapolate from the Yellow and Red Quadrants to understand how we want people to feel about the Brand.


9. Tone of Voice. As we look at the ‘Emotional Engagement’ we can deduce how we need to talk to customers and clients to evoke the desired feelings.


We know have a holistic, whole brain picture of the brand. This understanding allows us to address and appeal to all thinking preferences. No matter who investigates this brand, they will find a perspective that matches their preferred way of exploring and understanding the world.


Finally, we’re going to add to this understanding by exploring the Brand’s Higher Purpose.


10. The Why. Why do we exist? What is our purpose over and beyond commercial success?


11. How do we achieve our purpose? What is our strategy?


12. What exactly do we do? What are our different products and services?


So, this brings us back to the centre of our schematic.


The Brand Promise.


If we can synthesise and distil the different perspectives, the different ideas, facts and claims on this page into a promise that embraces the filters of the Whole Brain model, we’ll have identified the enduring DNA of the brand. We’ll have created a solid platform that allows for change and future growth.


And while that core promise endures, we’ll be able to keep it fresh and relevant by promoting it through constantly changing campaigns. We can use a wide range of attention-grabbing ideas and executions, as long as we stay relevant to the core promise.


I’d like to finish this module by explaining why I feel it’s important that we capture all of this information on a single page.


While working as a Creative Director, I came to appreciate the crucial role that the strategy department played in the development of our ideas.


Without insightful strategic thinking, we didn’t have a brief that could lead to fresh, differentiating, creative work.


It really was that simple.


And I think that’s why strategy departments within agencies are enjoying an increasingly prominent and valued role, particularly as consumer contact points are proliferating within digital media and consistent messaging is crucial for cut through and memorability.


However, I feel some brand consultancies measure their worth in the sheer volume of material they dump on the client’s desk. While I’m not challenging the value of research, or the need for in-depth analysis of the market, the consumer, the trends and so on, I do believe that for a Brand Strategy to succeed it needs to be succinct.


While a series of ring-binders full of brand and consumer exploration may indeed represent a great deal of work and understanding, it’s most likely to act as dust gathering equipment on a shelf in the corner.


It needs to be distilled.


Hence my attachment to this Brand-on-page.


But I should add, this is a Brand Document. It defines and supports the core promise of the Brand.


It’s not a marketing plan on a page. That requires us to investigate the consumer through the four lenses of the Whole Brain Model and we’ll be covering that in great depth in a different module.
