WHY ARE BRANDS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE?


We’re now operating in a marketing and media environment that has become obsessed with reach, likes, hits, page impressions, and various metrics that hint at levels of consumer engagement.


However, in the midst of this data storm, it’s essential that we remain focused on the importance of having a meaningful, consistent, core brand message.


There are five reasons for this.


First, market saturation.


Every category is crowded with parity products, most of them selling themselves on very similar customer benefits. Differentiation is critical and can only be achieved through consistency of brand communication. Irrespective of what you are selling, your brand can always be different, memorable and relevant to the consumer and therein lies your competitive advantage.


Second, information overload.


In the pre-digital era, back when I was working in London, I remember a research company telling me that I was exposed to around 500 ads every day – on the TV, newspapers, going to work on the Tube, reading the occasional magazine. It seemed like an exaggeration to me as I didn’t notice most of them.


Today, in our screen-addicted lives, that estimate has climbed to over 10,000 advertising messages a day. And now I do believe it!


We are bombarded. It’s a blitz! And yet most of these messages go unnoticed. Only those that are recognised and relevant get through. Your brand, your consistent messaging, is how you get noticed and remembered in this environment.


Third, emotional connectivity.


While people might appraise your product logically and rationally, they’ll buy your brand emotionally. They’ll buy your values, the sense of identity you can share with them, and the feelings you inspire. People think with their head but, more often than not, they buy with their heart.


Fourth, the narrative hijack.


Media consumption is no longer passive. People don’t just read, they post!! Your product and brand are no longer simply what you claim them to be, they’re also what your audience is saying about them. One tweet can change your reputation overnight. And other platforms can then amplify that story. Particularly if it’s a bad story as that unfortunately, is how the Internet tends to operate. Your only defence is to have a clear, consistent brand identity that you protect and reinforce in all communication.


Fifth, the global economy and marketing sphere.


Even if you are only selling locally, which is increasingly unlikely, you are competing globally. Your target is receiving product and brand messaging from all over the world and that will affect how they view your product and brand. Positively or negatively. And so, your brand needs to give you a competitive edge against a much wider range of competitors than are immediately apparent in your neighbourhood.


All of which brings us back to the all-important question.


How do we build a brand that is relevant, motivating and memorable - one that engages both the head and the heart of our audience?


Well, there is a process. And our next module, an exploration of Whole Brain Thinking, explains a methodology that will enable us to deconstruct a brand, understand its component parts and broaden its appeal and relevance to the widest possible audience.
