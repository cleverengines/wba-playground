WHOLE BRAND EXERCISES


While these ideas probably make sense to you theoretically, there’s no substitute for putting them into practice to see how they really work.


So, I suggest you complete these simple exercises and explore the possibilities of the Whole Brain Branding concept.


If you have questions, or find yourself struggling with some aspect of the process, you can contact us directly at ihaveaquestion@wholebrandacademy.com


1. GUESS YOUR OWN PROFILE


In our experience, when people guess their own thinking profile, they are remarkably accurate.


But that said, we’d always recommend you go to the Herrmann website and sign up to complete the questionnaire and get a more detailed and validated result.


But, in the comfort of your own home, or office or wherever you may be, there is a pretty simple process for generating a DIY profile.


Essentially you need to answer just four questions. So, get a pencil and paper and write your answers down.


1. On a scale of 0-12 how much do you like numbers, facts, data, and analysis. How much do you like deconstructing things to understand them. How important is scientific proof to you?


If this is not your preferred way of understanding the world, give yourself a low score. But if you love this hype rational approach to evaluating a situation, give yourself a high score.


2. On a scale of 0-10 how much do you like systems and process? Do you operate more effectively within well-defined timelines and budgets? Do you like rules and guidelines that define expectations?


If this is not your preferred way of living in the world, give yourself a low score. But if you like structure, organisation, deadlines and clearly defined limits, give yourself a high score.


3. On a scale of 0-10 how often do you make decisions intuitively? Do you focus on people, how they feel, how you feel, on relationships? Do you go with your gut more than you head?


If this is not your preferred way of interacting with the world, give yourself a low score. But if you are a ‘people’ person, one that is emotionally connected to outcomes and who is led by feeling, give yourself a high score.


4. On a scale of 0-10 how highly do you value and participate in innovation and creative thinking? Do you prefer the thrill of the new to the safety of the predictable? Do you like to challenge the established order?


If this is not your preferred way of thinking and behaving, give yourself a low score. But if you like the chaotic process of change, of forging a new but uncertain path and finding original solutions, then give yourself a high score.


So, how do we use these four numbers you’ve written down?


Simple.


Draw a circle and divide it into four quadrants.


(Insert circle with four quadrants divided.)


Now draw in these diagonal lines. We’re going to plot your scores on these.


(Insert circle with diagonal lines drawn)


So, imagine each diagonal line is a ruler. Zero is in the centre of the circle and 10 is at the perimeter. 5 is in the middle.


You don’t need to be too exact.


But take the four numbers you have in the order in which we asked the questions – that order is Blue, Green, Red and Yellow.


Let’s imagine your scores were 5, 8, 4, 2.


On this line you’d make a mark half way. That’s your Blue score. And then for the Green, you’d be much closer to the perimeter. For Red you’d be slightly inside the halfway mark. And for Yellow you’d be quite close to the centre.


(Insert video that shows these marks appearing on the diagonal lines.)


Now just join the dots like this.


(Insert video of the dots being joined.)


And here you have it, your guesstimate of your Whole Brain Profile.


In this case, of course yours might be very different, we’re looking at the profile of someone who is predominantly left-brained, loves systems and process and is well organised, is comfortable with the data and analysis. But on the right-hand side is not driven by emotion and doesn’t like the disruption of innovation or creativity.


As you can see, it’s quite a graphical representation as you can identify thinking styles and preferences very quickly.


So, guess your own profile and keep it beside you for the next exercises.


(We always recommend that you have your HBDI profile professionally created by the Herrmann organisation. You can contact them directly at www.thinkherrmann.com)


2. GUESS SOMEONE ELSE’S PROFILE


Once you understand the concept, you’ll be surprised by how quickly you can apply it to other people. So, guess the profiles of:


A close friend or partner


Someone you work with


Someone you know quite well but don’t get on easily with


Someone famous that you don’t know personally


Someone you admire


Now compare you profile with these profiles and see if the difference between yours and theirs throws any light on how you relate to these people.


3. GUESS A BRAND’S PROFILE


This is another compare and contrast exercise.


Start by doing two profiles. One of Apple Computers and one of Microsoft computers.


For each profile ask the same questions:


How focused is this brand on process and systems?


How focused is this brand on data and numbers?


How focused is this brand on people?


How focused is this brand on creativity?


And remember, you are thinking about the brand, not the product. These days Apple computers and Microsoft computers do many, if not all, of the same things. But they come from very different brands. Use the Whole Brain Model to understand the distinction.


4. GUESS A BRAND’S CORE PROMISE


Take five of your favourite brands, from any category, and guess each one’s core promise. Don’t be fooled by any advertising endlines, these can change like the wind. Try and look deeper. It might help to draw the Brand’s profile and see if the core promise comes from multiple quadrants.


5. GUESS A BRAND’S HIGHER PURPOSE


Take the same five brands and see if you can identify the Brand’s higher purpose, its ‘Why?’, the reason it exists beyond making money for the employees and shareholders.


The next five exercises are best done with a brand you know well. Maybe it’s a brand you use, or maybe it’s a brand you work for. But, if possible, choose a brand that you know from the inside as well as the outside.


6. Use the worksheets from module 13 and apply the principles of Brand Belief.


7. Use the worksheets from module 14 and complete a Brand Star.


8. Use the worksheets from module 15 and imagine a Brand Trajectory.


9. Use the worksheets from module 16 and identify the Brand Archetypes.


10. Use the worksheets from module 17 and deduce three Claims along with their Values and Proof points.
