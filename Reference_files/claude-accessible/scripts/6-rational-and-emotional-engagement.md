RATIONAL AND EMOTIONAL ENGAGEMENT


Now that we’ve investigated the brand through the four different filters of Whole Brain Thinking, we can determine how to build a rational and an emotional relationship with our audience.


By combining the Blue and Green quadrants we are effectively using all of the information that appeals to the rational, left-hand side of our brains. And so, from this information, we can develop a pitch or claim for the brand that is essentially rational in nature.


Let’s use the biG Whole Brain deconstruction again and see how exactly this works.


(Insert slide that shows the Green Quadrant from biG)


Here’s what we said in the Green Quadrant about HOW we work, how we bring value to the market, how we operate.


(Superimpose the Blue Quadrant above the Green)


And this is what we said in the Blue Quadrant. These are the facts that make our claims credible. As it says here, ‘Our source of Authority’.


Now let’s ask ourselves what sort of rational relationship we can build with our target audience based on the information in these two quadrants. Or, to put it another way, how do we want our audience to think about us?


Here’s how we distilled it:


“These guys, (that’s us at biG), will deliver what I need. They’re highly rated by the industry and their clients, bring diverse but integrated skills, a unique and proven methodology and bucket loads of experience. Plus, their business model is going to save me money.”


We always express these thoughts as if we are quoting the client, as if they are telling us what they think. What we want them to think!


And you’ll see there is nothing in these sentiments that doesn’t directly relate to the claims and facts in the Green and Blue Quadrants.


So, if that is how we want our clients to think about us, the question is how do we want our clients to feel?


To create a Whole Brand relationship with clients, their feelings are every bit as important as their thoughts. Some would argue more so!


So, we follow the same process, but on the other side of the brain.


(Insert slide of biG’s Yellow Quadrant.)


You’ll remember that we put these claims and facts into the Yellow Quadrant. This is why we said we were different to others in our category and why we feel we have an exciting future.


(Superimpose Blue Quadrant beneath the Yellow.)


And, here in the Red Quadrant is how we described Who we are in human terms – our style and personality, the behaviour we adopt that builds relationships.


So now we look at how these two perspectives can be combined to define how we’d like our clients to feel about us. Not to think, to feel. These quadrants are on the right-hand side of the brain.


Once again, we express this relationship in words we’d like the clients to use:


“I’m in safe hands with these guys. They have C-Suite experience and so they understand my situation. Plus, they have a ‘roll-up-your sleeves’ enthusiasm for the work and will actually be on the tools themselves.”


The main out-take of this right brain engagement is the emotion of reassurance – Accessibility, Safety, Confidence.


While on the left-brain side we are inspiring credibility, certainty and proof - a very different type of reassurance.


But put the two together and we have a ‘Whole Brand’ relationship that appeals to all thinking preferences and styles. To the head as well as the heart!


However, there’s one last extrapolation we can make before we focus on the Core Brand Promise.


Once again, it requires us to separate the left brain from the right brain.


(Insert slide that shows Blue Quadrant, Green Quadrant and Rational Engagement boxes.)


So, if we look at these three boxes, we can ask ourselves what are the attitudes and behaviours we need to adopt if we are to build this very positive, rational relationship.


We call these ‘Service Drivers’.


In our case, we feel we need to be diverse in our thinking, not in the sociological sense but in the sense of listening to different points of view.


We need to be pioneering and innovative. We need the entrepreneurial drive to find new processes and methods.


And lastly, we need dedication to a ‘good is never good enough’ attitude. We need to employ what my old boss called ‘Constructive Dissatisfaction’, a restless desire to do better.


Those service drivers will help us build the desired rational relationship with our clients and are fundamental to our brand.


And, for the last time, if we scoot over to the right-hand side of the brain, we can use these three boxes to help us define the tone of voice we’ll need to adopt to build a relationship that reflects our brand personality.


As you can see, by combining the yellow and red boxes and bearing in mind the emotional engagement we are trying to achieve, our tone of voice needs to be:


Creative and Entrepreneurial – we need to offer fresh thinking.


Knowledgeable and Insightful – we need to show we not only know the business but we know them and can demonstrate a transformative understanding of what they are trying to do.


And lastly, Friendly, Enthusiastic and Committed – we’re going to be easy to work with and bring energy and dedication to the challenge.


Tone of voice, while it sits on the right-hand side of this schematic, has a whole brain value. It’s immensely important to Red Quadrant thinkers because it helps them imagine the relationship they can have with the brand and recognise its values.


But consistency in tone of voice is similarly important to the left-hand side of the brain. Blue Quadrant thinkers will spot inconsistency immediately. They will equate a lack of consistency in tone of voice with a lack of certainty and integrity and start to lose trust in what you are saying.


So, we now have a whole brain deconstruction of the brand, and extrapolations that allow us to define the rational and emotional relationships we are striving to create and the tone of voice and service drivers that will enable us to succeed.


Before we drill down and look at how we can extract a Core Brand Promise from this information, we’ll use a slightly different perspective and methodology to deepen our understanding of the brand we are trying to build.


So, in the next module, we’ll explore Simon Sinek’s Why, How, What model and see what it can add to the picture we are building.
