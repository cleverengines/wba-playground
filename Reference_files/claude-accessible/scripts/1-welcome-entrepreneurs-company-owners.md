WELCOME TO ENTREPRENEURS AND COMPANY OWNERS


“Hello and welcome to the curriculum for Entrepreneurs and Company Owners.


You certainly don’t need me to tell you what a competitive environment you are now operating in. It’s most likely that your category is crowded with parity or ‘me too’ products and services as well as newcomers who are trying to steal both your customers’ attention and your business opportunities.


And if you are in that rare and enviable position of having something that’s truly unique, it’s sad to say that your advantage may not last for long – such is the nature of competitive marketing.


So, in this hyper-connected digital environment, brands have become more important than ever. And not only for salience, that ‘stand-out’ factor or for differentiation. A well-defined and well-managed brand can engender credibility and trust among consumers who are bombarded with conflicting messages and a plethora of choices. And that trust leads to loyalty, to retention and, perhaps most importantly, to advocacy. To recommendation. In a digital space where social proof and influence are of paramount importance, your consumers can become your most powerful marketing department.


But, that said, it’s only half the story and only half the opportunity.


Your ‘inner brand’, or ‘employer brand’ as some would call it, can drive massive efficiencies and productivity. It’s essential that your employees buy into your brand with the same values and philosophy that your customers buy your products or services. We call this Brand Symmetry and it’s at the core of your potential to evolve and become increasingly competitive. It’s an essential tool for growing revenue and reducing cost.


So, in this curriculum we’ll use Whole Brand Thinking to help you develop Brand Symmetry and achieve the following:


You’ll deepen your understanding of your target audience and refine your core proposition and brand promise.


You’ll get more bang for your marketing buck because you’ll develop a more competitive brand that consumers are endorsing and, in so doing, expanding your market.


That’s on the outside.


On the inside, you’ll be recruiting better people, and they’ll stay with you for longer.


You’ll build a stronger culture and a more collaborative and productive team.


And should the need arise, you’ll find your operation and ‘brand value’ will be more appealing to investors.


In the process of achieving this, you may need to upskill some of your employees. In this course you’ll find modules that use the organising principle of Whole Brain Thinking to improve,


Presentations


Business writing and communication


Negotiation


Leadership


Time management.


We’ll also look at how to use our Ideascape concept to develop an innovation culture – one in which creativity plays a role in solving problems.


But it all starts with ‘Brand’ and so I invite you to look at the free introductory module which gives a clear and simple understanding of ‘What is a brand?’ and why is it the foundation of your business and future growth.
