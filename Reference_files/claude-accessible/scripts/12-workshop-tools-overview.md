WORKSHOP TOOLS OVERVIEW


Few, if any, brands are created by an individual. Brand building is a team exercise and it’s more than likely that you’ll find yourself working alongside colleagues from different disciplines and departments as you try to understand the core values and ideas you want to instil in the organisation.


Sometimes these conversations will be unstructured and free-ranging and there is a real value in that. Creative ideas often come from unexpected connections and a free-flowing conversation will often stimulate new and interesting opportunities.


But there will be times when you struggle to make headway and will find yourself going over old ground as you try to make progress.


On such occasions, it’s useful to have a structured conversation that has an outcome in mind.


In this section of the course, you’ll find six workshop tools that will help you stimulate ideas by steering your thinking along pre-determined pathways. This does not mean you’ll always come to the same conclusions. Far from it. These are frameworks for conversation and thinking, they do not pre-determine the outcome. In fact, I’ve been using these tools for many years and have never seen them take me to the same place twice!


As with everything we do here at the Whole Brand Academy, I’ve organised the tools so that they fit the Whole Brain Model.


This is not a precise process as many of these tools overlap into two or more quadrants. But taken as a toolkit of six approaches to deconstructing a brand, I’m confident that all thinking preferences are covered.


I’ll give you a quick overview of each one and you’ll find full instructions for how to use them in each of the modules in this section.


1. Brand Belief. Essentially this is a Green Quadrant approach to deconstructing the Brand. It compartmentalises the customers and target audience and looks at the different relationships consumers have developed with the brand. (So, there’s a little bit of the Red Quadrant in there.) This understanding can lead to strategies for improving consumer perceptions.


2. Brand Star. We think of this as a Blue Quadrant exercise as it asks participants to score five core attributes of the brand. This is a great process for evaluating strengths and weaknesses and developing strategies to improve internal performance and guide communication strategy.


3. Brand Trajectory. This is very much a Yellow Quadrant exercise as it asks participants to look at how the brand will grow and develop in the coming years and how it will maintain differentiation in a changing market.


4. Brand Archetypes. Understanding the emotional attachment a brand develops is very much a Red Quadrant exercise. Brand Archetypes are a very quick and simple way of getting participants to define how they feel, not think about a brand. This process is very helpful in establishing tone of voice, language and brand imagery.


5. Claim, Value, Proof. This process is essential when considering communication strategy. It forces participants to look at the brand through the eyes of the end-user and appreciate the true value they are seeking. It’s more of a Whole Brain exercise as it covers both rational and emotional values.


6. The Five Whys. Again, this is something of a Whole Brain exercise as it can be applied to any claim you might make for a brand – rational or emotional. It’s simple process that forces participants to look deeper, to look underneath the claims that they take for granted.


In each module, you’ll find downloadable worksheets that will step you through the process of each of the exercises.


These sessions always generate a lot of ideas and unearth thoughts that have long been forgotten about the brand. (Many participants will be surprised that they knew more about the brand than they had realised!) So, it’s important that you have someone whose responsibility is to capture the outputs so that you can then evaluate how they fit into the Whole Brand Model.
