# Launch Offering and Structure

We've designed WholeBrand Academy to offer value to businesses at every stage of their brand journey. Here's how we're approaching it:

## WholeBrand Blueprint - Buy-Once, Core Product ($1,500 - $3,000)

This is the long-term toolkit. Comprehensive, practical, and designed to deliver immediate and lasting value. With frameworks, video-based training, and expert insights, individuals & businesses will walk away with everything they need to build smarter, stronger brands.

**Includes:**
- Lifetime access to the course lessons, materials and downloads
- Includes access to the Brand Potency Launchpad ($500 value)
- Includes access to BrandCanvas - Your Brand-on-a-page ($750 value)
- 12 updates per year
- Community Connection - connect with thousands of like minded peers
- Quarterly interactive virtual sessions, with Q&A

## Crash Courses ($100 - $500)

Quick, actionable, and low-commitment. These introductory courses provide immediate value while giving us the chance to nurture relationships and funnel participants into our more comprehensive offerings.

- **Brand Potency Launchpad** - A comprehensive quickstart guide to launching your brand with the base fundamentals to set a foundation for performance.
- **BrandCanvas** - Organise your entire brand onto a single page. Highly effective for clarity, alignment and communication with your team and contractors.

## Schedule - Additional Content and Communication Strategy

### Monthly Course Updates
- 12 month plan of content topics to record (1 per month minimum)
- These will bulk out the core product, adding more content and value
- Gives us natural promo points and newsletter content, for upcoming entries and recently explored topics now available. Help avoid repetitive generic sales messaging, and provides a reason to be talking to the audience

**Example**: September topic = Nurturing: Getting new leads to love your brand. In August we begin pushing out promos about "next month we're diving into how to nurture your leads with specific automated email sequences to turn them into customers and loyal clients. This is your time to join WBA to make sure your hard work getting leads converts to strong ROAS and happy loyal fans."

- Use as semi interactive webinars for both sales and feedback opportunities

### Social and Newsletter Content Schedule
- Start with 6 topics each from everyone, and deadline dates next to each for 500-1000 words
- This will give us close to 5 months of content frames we can build all our micro content, promos and list generation content off
- Combine this with the monthly update topics and we have a full slate of strategic content to use across all channels that is relevant and on-brand

## Pricing Projections

**Notes**: Following our chat recently I have removed the interactive version of the product, and the team version for 2 reasons. 1. They're trading time for money which isn't scalable. 2. We should focus on the MVP for simplicity and market testing.

The New/mo column indicates how many new customers per month are coming in. the 64.5 number is 15 per week, I would hope we can smash through that ceiling and do at least 25/week once we get inertia.
