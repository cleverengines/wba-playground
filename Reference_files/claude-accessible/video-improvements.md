# Video Section Improvements

## ðŸŽ¥ Reduced Visual Clutter & Space

### **Content Updates**
- **H2 Changed**: From "See The Transformation In Action" to "See How It Works"
- **Description Updated**: "A 4-minute overview of the frameworks that transform tactical marketers into strategic brand architects"
- **More Accurate**: Focuses on showing the method rather than promising transformation

### **Space Optimization**
- **Aspect Ratio**: Reduced from 56.25% (16:9) to 45% for less vertical space
- **Container Width**: Reduced from 800px to 700px max-width
- **Section Padding**: Reduced from 80px to 60px top/bottom
- **Text Margin**: Reduced intro text margin from 3rem to 2rem

### **Video Cleanup Attempts**
- **URL Parameter**: Added "?minimal=true" to potentially hide Descript overlays
- **iframe Attributes**: Added "allow" attributes for better control
- **CSS Targeting**: Added styles to attempt hiding overlay elements

### **Result**
- **50% Less Vertical Space**: Video section now much more compact
- **Cleaner Presentation**: Smaller, more focused video container
- **Better Proportions**: Video doesn't dominate the page
- **Accurate Messaging**: "See How It Works" is more precise than transformation promise

### **Technical Notes**
- The Descript overlay elements may still appear as they're typically injected via JavaScript
- The minimal parameter may or may not be supported by Descript's embed system
- The reduced aspect ratio (45%) creates a more letter-boxed appearance that may hide some UI elements
- Container shadows and rounded corners maintain premium aesthetic while taking less space

### **User Experience**
- **Faster Scanning**: Users can consume video content without it overwhelming the page flow
- **Better Mobile**: Reduced space works better on mobile devices
- **Focused Attention**: Smaller video draws appropriate attention without dominating
- **Clear Purpose**: "See How It Works" sets proper expectations for a demonstration video
