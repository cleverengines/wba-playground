## WholeBrand Academy: Go To Market Approach

### Advertising Strategy Summary

Pre-launch we have the CRM set up to accept leads, and put them into the various lead nurturing funnels. Then we use Nick and Mike's LinkedIn profile to make personal announcements about the launch of WholeBrand Academy. We go for network effect comments/reposts/shares to begin building awareness and a list.

Then we use a combination of organic posts offering some value, plus a CTA to join the "beta test cohort" or "case study group" at a discount/free to get traction and feedback. This is used in conjunction with social ads, specifically 1) dangling carrots to motivate leads to give contact details in exchange for something, and 2) direct sales offers.

### Marketing Channels

1. **Organic LinkedIn Posts**: Utilise personal networks to announce the Academy's launch, encouraging early sign-ups with discounted memberships for limited early access.

2. **Paid Social Media Ads (Daily Budget of AUD $150-200)**: Ads on Meta and LinkedIn, directing targeted traffic to the Academy's lead generation pages.
   - Free workshop registration (webinar sales pitch)
   - Try the course (access to the first module, with rest locked)
   - Lead magnet - TBC - something they can use immediately.

3. **Free Webinars**: Showcase course segments, culminating in a limited-time discounted offer for webinar attendees, with email follow-ups.

4. **Lead Magnet Content Teasers**: Offer a small, free course segment to pique interest, showing the rest of the course structure as visible but locked, prompting upgrades. This gets them in the door, familiar with system and delivery, at no cost to us - we get their contact info for lead nurturing and upsell.

## Tech Stack Overview

This simplified tech stack focuses on automation and user experience, optimising the setup for scalability:

### 1. LMS (Learning Management System): Podia, Mighty Networks, Thinkific, or Skool

**Features Needed**:
- Tiered access and gated content for restricted views on lead magnet content.
- Community features for interaction and support.
- Video and worksheet hosting for a complete learning experience.

**Recommendation**: Podia or Thinkific offer strong gated content capabilities and user-friendly setups, ideal for handling locked course sections that act as teasers.

### 2. CRM: Go High Level (GHL)

**Purpose**: Manages customer data, automates follow-ups, and drives engagement.

**Key Features**:
- Automated email follow-ups for webinar and lead magnet users.
- Lead segmentation and scoring to tailor communications.
- Integration with the LMS and payment processor for a seamless experience.
- *Bonus* - I just found out these guys also have a course hosting LMS function built into their recent release. Fully integrated with the CRM might be good.

### 3. Payment Processor: Lemon Squeezy

**Purpose**: Manages payments, subscription management, and tax compliance.

**Key Features**:
- Automated billing, international tax compliance, and self-serve customer dashboards.
- Secure checkout and digital rights management for protected content access.
- Note: We may be able to do without this in the early stages, but at scale it will reduce admin load, and enable international transactions easier.

### 4. Video Editing Tool: Descript (Basic Plan)

**Purpose**: For producing and editing course content videos efficiently.
**Features**: Basic editing tools, transcription, and audio cleanup to streamline video production.
**Cost**: AUD $15 per month.

## Specific Recommendations & Implementation Details

### 1. Referral System (Organic LinkedIn Posts)

- **Encourage Sharing**: Use LinkedIn posts to incentivise early sign-ups to refer others, offering discounts or small bonuses for successful referrals.
- **Tracking with GHL**: Create a referral tracking system in GHL, assigning referral codes or notes for each referral sign-up.
- **Offer a Discount or Access Perk**: For each successful referral, early users could receive a discount on additional resources or early access to future content.

### 2. Countdown Reminders (Webinar Follow-Ups)

- **48-Hour Limited Offer Sequence**: After the webinar, GHL will send a sequence of reminders to attendees to take advantage of a limited-time discount.
- **Suggested Email Sequence**:
  - **Immediately After Webinar**: Thank attendees, provide offer details, and highlight the 48-hour deadline.
  - **24-Hour Reminder**: Reinforce urgency and benefits.
  - **4-Hour Last Call**: Emphasise this is the final opportunity to secure the offer.

### 3. Content Tease (Lead Magnet Ads)

- **Locked Module Approach**: In the LMS, create a free access course with limited modules available, showing the rest as visible but locked to encourage upgrades.
- **Follow-Up Funnel**: Use GHL to create a follow-up email sequence that nurtures leads from the free teaser to the full buy-once product.

## Monthly Cost Breakdown

Below is the updated cost breakdown, reflecting the simplified stack and daily ad budget in AUD and USD:

| Item | Monthly Cost (AUD) | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| LMS (Podia or Thinkific) | AUD $55 - $60 | USD $36 - $39 | Strong gated content and lead magnet support. |
| Go High Level (CRM) | AUD $180/$449 | USD $119/$297 | For automated follow-ups and segmentation. |
| Lemon Squeezy | Transaction Fees | Transaction Fees | 5% fee per transaction, applied as sales occur. |
| Descript (Video Editing) | AUD $15 | USD $10 | Basic plan for video editing. |
| Social Media Ads (Meta & LinkedIn) | AUD $4,500 - $6,000 | USD $3,000 - $4,000 | Daily budget of AUD $150-200. |
| **Total Estimated Monthly Cost** | **AUD $4,750 - $6,255** | **USD $3,165 - $4,168** | Excludes variable transaction fees. |

## Additional Considerations

- **Video and Content Production**: With Descript's Basic Plan, initial content production will be cost-effective, although you may want to consider additional editing resources as content volume grows.
- **Payment Processing Fees**: Lemon Squeezy's transaction fees are applied per sale. Given your initial price point, consider incorporating these costs into product pricing for better profit margin tracking.
- **Go High Level's new LMS**: sounds really promising, and may offer additional benefits of having the full customer lifecycle integrated in the CRM. The only downsides I foresee is that it may have limited functionality compared to established standalone LMS options, and the backend interface may be harder. Also maybe not.
- **Martech Support**: It may be beneficial to offshore a MarTech admin person to assist with the setup and maintenance of the system. Philippines F/T approx $12K/year
