# Addressing Key Challenges

## A. Balancing Content for Different Learners

Our audience will range from brand newbies to seasoned strategists, so we're developing content that can flex for all levels:

**Solution:** Separate learning tracks that cater to both beginners and advanced users, with layered delivery from bite-sized videos to deep-dive case studies. No one will be left behind, but no one will be bored either.

## B. Maintaining Engagement in the Premium Model

Engagement is key if we want to build long-term relationships:

**Solution:** Regularly refreshed/updated, exclusive content, combined with possible live sessions that keep participants connected and learning. We're creating a living, breathing course—constantly evolving and keeping people excited to stay engaged. We can choose to offer interaction and tailored/customised feedback, 1-1, 1-many, workshops etc.

**Problem**: This interaction goes against the leveraged/scalability first mindset to achieve a lifestyle business model. So we need to balance our needs/wants as owners with the expectations and retention of customers.

## C. Justifying the $3K Price Tag for Buy-Once Product

For the buy-once model, perceived value is everything:

**Solution:** This isn't just another online course. We'll position it as a permanent business asset—something they can return to over time as their brand grows. It's about longevity, with real-world case studies, templates, and frameworks that show tangible results. Updated frequently, with timeless methods to handle timely challenges.

**Problem:** We have no idea yet whether the $1500 or $3000 price point is correct and achievable. There's already a wide spread between those. Lower price = less friction to entry, but more customers needed, and may damage a premium reputation. Higher price needs a remarkable value proposition, and reputation (which we don't have upon launch)

## D. Ensuring Platform Scalability

We need a platform that grows with us:

**Solution:** A low cost LMS and CRM will give us the flexibility we need. The system will be modular, so as we grow, we can add features without needing to overhaul anything. The data will all be stored in the platform, and backed up securely outside the platform so if at any point in future we want/need to change platforms we can do so.

## Bridging Gaps for a Better Experience

### A. Streamlined Onboarding for Immediate Wins
We'll focus on a seamless onboarding experience that quickly gets people comfortable:

**Solution**: A well-guided, intuitive process that delivers early wins, ensuring participants start with a clear sense of direction and value. Onboarding and early check ins will be key here for members to orient themselves and get going.

### B. Building a Collaborative Community
Community is where we'll add depth to the experience:

**Solution**: By fostering collaboration through live discussions and forums, we'll turn learners into an active community. This won't just be a course—it'll be a place to connect, share, and grow together. We can look at private groups on the LMS, social media, Whatsapp etc where they can share ideas and ask community questions.

As a potential bonus, we could look to use the community angle to recommend contractors in the network, similar to what biG currently does already.

### C. Post-Course Engagement
We want to keep them coming back:

**Solution**: Automated drip campaigns will continue the conversation after the course, offering exclusive content or pushing them toward the premium subscription. The goal is to make sure the value keeps flowing. We will also design progress feedback touch points, for locating them in the journey, and identifying relevant learnings for their situation.
