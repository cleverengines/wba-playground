# A Realistic, Structured Timeline for Launch

We all have full-time roles, so this needs to fit within realistic constraints. I propose a 6-month roadmap for the MVP launch, allowing us to build at a steady, sustainable pace without sacrificing quality.

## Phase 1: Planning and Content Mapping (Month 1)

- **Goal**: Finalise the concept, course structure, assign roles, and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to track our success.
- **Output**: A complete content map and clear ownership of tasks.

## Phase 2: System Setup & Branding Development (Month 2)

- **Goal**: Establish the platform and develop branding.
- **Output example**: Skool integrated with Go High Level, branding elements finalised, and course layout ready for content.

## Phase 3: Content Creation (Month 3-4)

- **Goal**: Produce the core content for the buy-once product and crash courses.
- **Output**: Completed video modules, templates, and course materials, ready for pre-launch testing.

## Phase 4: Pre-Launch Marketing and Testing (Month 5)

- **Goal**: Run beta tests and generate interest through organic marketing on our networks.
- **Output**: Feedback from testers and initial interest built through organic social posts.

## Phase 5: Webinar Launch & Sales Funnel (Month 6)

- **Goal**: Deliver a free webinar that serves as both a value-packed session and an integrated sales pitch for the full course. This may be the bread and butter way we approach scale up and membership, using tactics like authority, anchoring and scarcity/urgency to prompt commitment. A Sales mindset and commitment to a strategy and regular schedule will be important for conversion.
- **Output**: The MVP is live, with early customer feedback and first sales.
