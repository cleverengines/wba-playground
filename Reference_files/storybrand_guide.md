## The 7 Essential Sound Bites Framework

### 1. What Your Customer Wants
**What it is:** Define the ONE specific thing your company provides
- ✅ **Good:** "A roof on budget, on time, within 14 days"
- ❌ **Bad:** "Trust is the commodity we exchange"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Is it specific and concrete?
- [ ] Could this be misunderstood by anyone?
- [ ] Does it focus on ONE thing (not 10)?
- [ ] Can you put this on your business card?

### 2. The Problem You Solve
**What it is:** The specific problem your product/service resolves
- This is the MOST IMPORTANT sound bite
- People only buy solutions to problems

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Does this clearly state a pain point?
- [ ] Would someone immediately think "Yes, that's my problem"?
- [ ] Is it specific enough to be actionable?
- [ ] Does it make someone want to pull out their credit card?

### 3. Position Yourself as the Guide (Not the Hero)
**What it is:** Two-part sound bite showing empathy + competency
- **Empathy:** "If you struggle with X, we feel your pain"
- **Competency:** "We've solved this for thousands of people"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Does it show you understand their pain?
- [ ] Does it demonstrate your ability to solve it?
- [ ] Are you positioning the CUSTOMER as the hero?
- [ ] Do you avoid making your company the center of attention?

### 4. The Three-Step Plan
**What it is:** Simple baby steps from problem to solution
- Example: "Schedule consultation → Get custom report → Start implementation"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Are there exactly 3 steps (not 2, not 5)?
- [ ] Is each step easy to understand?
- [ ] Does it feel achievable to the customer?
- [ ] Does it lead naturally to a purchase?

### 5. Call to Action
**What it is:** Direct statement using specific language
- **Magic phrase:** "If you are struggling with X, purchasing Y is the right decision"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Does it use the phrase "right decision"?
- [ ] Is it direct and clear?
- [ ] Does it reduce cognitive dissonance?
- [ ] Would someone feel confident taking action?

### 6. Success Vision
**What it is:** Paint picture of life AFTER buying your product
- Show the positive outcome they'll experience

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Is it specific and vivid?
- [ ] Does it connect to survival/thriving?
- [ ] Can the customer easily imagine this outcome?
- [ ] Is it emotionally compelling?

### 7. Failure Stakes
**What it is:** What happens if they DON'T buy
- Create urgency without being manipulative

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Does it create appropriate urgency?
- [ ] Is it honest and not fear-mongering?
- [ ] Does it highlight what they'll miss?
- [ ] Does it motivate action?

## Quality Control Questions

**For Any Piece of Content:**
1. Does this help customers survive/thrive?
2. Would a 5-year-old understand what we do?
3. Are we the guide or the hero in this message?
4. Does this pass the "2-second test"?
5. Is there a clear next step?

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- ❌ Vague, sophisticated-sounding language
- ❌ Making your company the hero
- ❌ Multiple value propositions
- ❌ Industry jargon
- ❌ Missing or weak CTAs
- ❌ No clear problem definition

## Missed Opportunities & Additional Considerations

### What You Might Be Missing:

1. **Customer Journey Mapping:** Apply the 7 sound bites at each stage of the buyer's journey
2. **Competitive Differentiation:** Use the framework to stand out from competitors who are being vague
3. **Internal Alignment:** Ensure sales, marketing, and customer service all use consistent messaging
4. **Measurement & Testing:** A/B test different versions of your sound bites
5. **Customer Feedback Integration:** Regularly validate that your problem definition matches real customer pain points
6. **Seasonal/Contextual Adaptation:** Adjust messaging for different times of year or market conditions
7. **Multi-Channel Consistency:** Ensure messaging works across all touchpoints (ads, website, sales calls, support)

### Advanced Implementation:
- Create message hierarchies for different customer segments
- Develop industry-specific versions of your core messages
- Build messaging playbooks for different team members
- Establish regular message audits and updates
- Create customer success stories that reinforce each of the 7 elements

### Technology Integration:
- Use marketing automation to deliver appropriate level messages based on engagement
- Implement chatbots that use your core sound bites
- Create dynamic website content that adapts messaging based on traffic source
- Develop sales enablement tools that prompt reps to use framework language

Remember: The goal is not perfection but clarity. Start with the basics, test, refine, and expand.
