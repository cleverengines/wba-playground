## The 12 Copywriting Commandments

### 1. Headlines Come First for a Reason
**Principle:** Your headline determines 80% of your ad's success. It's the biggest lever for performance.

**Implementation:**
- **Curiosity is king** - Create intrigue without revealing everything
- **Different is ideal** - Stand out from competitors
- **Sexy works** - Use emotionally compelling language
- **Never run without a headline** - Every ad has one, make yours intentional

**Examples:**
- ✅ **DO:** "How to speak confidently in front of strangers without ever practicing even if you're deathly afraid of speaking in public"
- ✅ **DO:** "How to [desired outcome] without [common obstacle] even if [biggest fear]"
- ❌ **DON'T:** Generic headlines like "Improve Your Business Today"

**Testing Strategy:**
- Study organic content that performs well in first 3 seconds
- Analyze successful ads from different industries
- Test headlines across industries (travel → business, weight loss → business)

### 2. Say What Only You Can Say
**Principle:** Proof beats promise. Competitors can copy your offer but not your unique story and achievements.

**Implementation:**
- State your unique credentials upfront
- Share specific, verifiable accomplishments
- Define your unique positioning in the market

**Examples:**
- ✅ **DO:** "We spent tens of millions of dollars on ads last year across our portfolio companies"
- ✅ **DO:** "The only triple black belt trainer in [city]"
- ✅ **DO:** "Only trainer who's helped vegan powerlifting moms over 35"
- ❌ **DON'T:** Generic claims anyone could make

**Action Items:**
- List all unique qualifications, certifications, achievements
- Document specific results you've delivered
- Create your unique positioning statement

### 3. Always Call Out Who You're Looking For (And Who You're Not)
**Principle:** Specificity creates self-selection. Saying "no" to wrong customers attracts right ones.

**Implementation:**
- Clearly identify your ideal customer
- Explicitly exclude who this isn't for (more powerful than inclusion)
- Use specific criteria, not vague descriptions

**Examples:**
- ✅ **DO:** "If you're below $250,000/year revenue, this isn't for you - go consume my free content"
- ✅ **DO:** "Only for people trying to lose over 30 pounds"
- ✅ **DO:** "For business owners doing $1M+ who want to scale to $10M+"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "For all business owners" or "Anyone can use this"

**Awareness Levels to Target:**
- **Unaware:** Hook with curiosity
- **Problem Aware:** "Do you get up at night to pee more than twice?"
- **Solution Aware:** "Have you tried supplements that didn't work?"
- **Product Aware:** "Have you tried this type vs. that type?"
- **Most Aware:** Direct offers to existing audience

### 4. Always Have a Reason Why
**Principle:** The word "because" is one of the most influential in English. Any reason is better than no reason.

**Implementation:**
- Use "because" to justify actions, offers, urgency
- The reason doesn't need to be earth-shattering
- Tie reasons to urgency/scarcity when possible

**Examples:**
- ✅ **DO:** "Special pricing because it's our company anniversary month"
- ✅ **DO:** "Limited spots because we can only handle 50 new clients"
- ✅ **DO:** "Free training because my dog's birthday is this month"
- ❌ **DON'T:** Make claims without justification

**Fraternity Party Planner Test:** If a reason is good enough for a college party, it's good enough for your offer.

### 5. Use Damaging Admissions
**Principle:** Admitting flaws upfront builds trust and makes your claims more believable.

**Implementation:**
- Own your flaws before prospects think them
- Use "Statement + BUT + What you want them to believe" structure
- Address common objections preemptively

**Examples:**
- ✅ **DO:** "Our gym has terrible parking and spotty AC, but our sessions are more fun than anyone else's"
- ✅ **DO:** "Our websites are ugly as hell, but they convert"
- ✅ **DO:** "This only works for 4-6 hours, but you'll have the time of your life"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Our systems work, but they're boring" (emphasizes wrong part)

**Structure:** [Damaging truth] + BUT + [Benefit they want]

### 6. Show, Don't Tell
**Principle:** Describe experiences and moments, not just outcomes.

**Implementation:**
- Paint specific picture
